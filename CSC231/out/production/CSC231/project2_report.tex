    \item Regular Expression for Language 1 is $(GT|C|\epsilon)(AG(AG)^*)(CT(CT)^*)G(GC|\epsilon)$
    \item Regular Expression for Language 2 is $(04|06|09|11)-((0|1|2)[0-9]|30)
    |(01|03|05|07|08|10|12)-((0|1|2)[0-9]|30|31)
    |02-((0|1)[0-9]|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28)$
    \item Regular Expression for Language 3 is $(00^*11^*22^*11^*00^*)|(00^*22^*00^*)$
\end{enumerate}
[0-9] means symbol $\backslash\backslash p\{Digit\}$ which means the number ranging from 0 to 9.

\section*{Explanation}
\subsection*{Language 1}
For Language 1 regular expression, union of $(GT|C|\epsilon)$ means an optional GT or C at the beginning of the word.
$AG(AG)^*CT(CT)^*$ means one or more instances of AG followed by one or more instances of CT.
$G(GC|\epsilon)$ means after one or more instances of AG and CT, follows by exactly one G and an optional GC at the end.
\subsection*{Language 2}
This part $(04|06|09|11)$ means union of months that only have 30 days. 
$((0|1|2)[0-9]|30)$ means the union of ${01,02,03,\dots, 09} | {10,11,\dots ,19}| {20,21,\dots, 29}| 30$, which represents all possible number from 00 to 30.\\
$(01|03|05|07|08|10|12)$ means the months that have 31 days, and $((0|1|2)[0-9]|30|31)$ means the union of previous set(all possible number from 00 to 30) and 31.
This means all number from 00 to 31.\\
In the last part of the big union, $02$ means February, and $((0|1)[0-9]|20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28)$ means the union of ${01,02,03,\dots, 09},{10,11,\dots ,19} $ and 21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28.
This part means all possible number from 00 to 28.
Taking the union of all three will het the optimal regular expression.

\subsection*{Language 3}
$(00^*11^*22^*11^*00^*)$ means the case that ascending component has one or more 1s. 
$00^*$ means one or more 0s to start. 
$11^*$ means followed by one of more 1s.
$22^*$ means one or more 2s.
The next $11^*00^*$ means in descending component, there must be one or more 1s followed by one or more 0s.\\
$(00^*22^*00^*)$ means the case of not any 1s in the ascending component.
$00^*22^*$ is the ascending component and $00^*$ mean the descending component.
