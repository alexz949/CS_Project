## Part1
For Part1, my codes are in file 'face_detection_still.py'. 'test_main.jpg' and 'test_shift.jpg' are test images for translation, rotation and scale changes.
It will produce 4 different images and try to draw a rectangle  on detected faces.

## Part2
For Part2, my codes are in file 'detect_faces_HOG.py', which I use HOG to test face detections. 'test_main.jpg' and 'test_shift.jpg' are also the test images.
It will have the same output as the codes in part1

## Part3
My codes for PArt3 are in 'video_detect.py'. If the file is executed, it will also create a new avi file which store the video capture stream. 'part3.mp4' is the demo video I create.

## Part4
'training_faces.py' is the file that I used to train faces. 'face_rec.py' is the file that I perform prediction.
