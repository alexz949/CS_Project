## Part 1
The file called "histEq" is for the section 1.
There are two functions "histEq" is my function and "cv_hist_eq" is the built-in function.

The file "conv" is for section 3.
There are also two functions one is called "conv" which is my function.
The second one is "cv_conv" which is the built-in function.

## Part 2
The file called "sobel_edge" is what I design my own image filter.
It basically does a edge detect filter and then so the vertical sobel filter which I believe it will make the edges more vivid.


## Part 3
The file "video_frame" is the video frame processing.
