\section*{Problem 1}
\subsection*{(a)}
The first suggestion is that this question should give some choices because most people don't really have a sense of how many potatoes they will eat for a whole year.\\
\\
The second suggestion is that I think question needs to explain more on potatoes. Whether smashed potato and fries consider as potato?
Or this question is just asking how many whole potatoes people eat.\\
\\
The third suggestion I can give is that instead of asking this long time, asking the frequency of eating potatoes within a week maybe more reasonable.
People have better memory on how many times they eat potatoes within a week than within a year. We can then estimate the number of potatoes they eat last year by roughly times the data 52 times\\



\subsection*{(b)}
The first suggestion is changing the description because it implied only recovering 10\% can serve 50 years. This is a leading question which people tend to support taking gas from shale because it just uses small percent.\\
\\
The second suggesion is giving explainations for natural gas and shale. Telling people what is shale will help them answer the question. Many people don't know what is shale so they may just agree because they know natual gas can be used for family based on the description.\\
\\
The thrid suggestion is making this question to be close question. Adding some choices like "strongly agree", "agree", "netural", "disagree", "strongly disagree" maybe better than this open question.
People may just write agree or disagree which is not specific.\\


\subsection*{(c)}
One suggestion is that now this question seems like a double barreled question. Some people may just think the Patriots is a good football team and vice versa.\\
\\
The second suggestion is to define "good" in question. Different people have different extends to say "good". For example, some people think getting into semi-final is already good but other may think being in the first place is good.\\
\\
The third suggestion is adding some descriptions on each team. Like how many games they won last season and how many trophies they have in the history. People who are not familiar with these two teams are hard to make decisions unless there are some standards.\\
